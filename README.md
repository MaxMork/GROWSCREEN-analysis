# GROWSCREEN-analysis
Here I save the script I wrote to analyze the GROWSCREEN analysis done in 2021 - 
Data will initially be stored by the GrowScreenChamber institution on the "Phenomis" database at IBG2. 
When the "Integrated Information System" of EPPN2020 will be ready, data will be saved there and made available to the EPPN community

Important note the dataset is to big to fit in excel sheets or on a clipboard so be sure to load in the file through R to get everything in. 
The script can be used for personaly use, when used for a publication please reference the publication of Max van Hooren in the JXB journal. Please do not use without explicit permission for commercial use.
