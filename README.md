# GROWSCREEN-analysis
Here I save the script I wrote to analyze the GROWSCREEN analysis done in 2021 - Data will initially be stored by the GrowScreenChamber institution on the "Phenomis" database at IBG2. When the "Integrated Information System" of EPPN2020 will be ready, data will be saved there and made available to the EPPN community
